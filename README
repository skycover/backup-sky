DESCRIPTION

Technically this is the wrapper around duplicity (http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)
to simplyfy config-based backups.
Initially it is created to automate backups to SkyCover Backup service
http://www.skycover.ru.

INSTALLATION

Install duplicity (http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)

Put the script backup-sky somewhere in your path, for ex. /usr/local/sbin,
and make it executable
# cp backup-sky /usrlocal/sbin
# chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/backup-sky

As root user execute it once

# backup-sky

The directory infrastructure will be prepared and the default files will be created.

NOTE: Alternatively you may install it anywhere for any user by editing "System names"
section in the head of the script.

Next you should carefully edit /etc/backup-sky/env to suit your needs.
The file is self-descriptive and is autogenerated on upgrades.
You will also need to generate ssh and gpg keys.

The final step is tuning /etc/backup-sky/targets with your backup descriptions.
The file has comments and examples. It is autogenerated only if it is missing.

USAGE

Execute backup-sky without any arguments to get help on the available commands.
In short it will be:

backup-sky <backup|status|list|restore|targets> [[TARGET|all] [full|inc] [duplicity args]]
